    <section class="main-content">
      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>  
      <p>Recent years have seen rapid progress in meta-learning methods, which learn (and optimize) the performance of learning methods based on data, generate new learning methods from scratch, and learn to transfer knowledge across tasks and domains. Meta-learning can be seen as the logical conclusion of the arc that machine learning has undergone in the last decade, from learning classifiers, to learning representations, and finally to learning algorithms that themselves acquire representations and classifiers. The ability to improve oneâ€™s own learning capabilities through experience can also be viewed as a hallmark of intelligent beings, and there are strong connections with work on human learning in neuroscience.</p>
      <p>Meta-learning methods are also of substantial practicalW interest, since they have, e.g., been shown to yield new state-of-the-art automated machine learning methods, novel deep learning architectures, and substantially improved one-shot learning systems.</p>
      <p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers from all the different communities. 
        We expect that the presence of these different communities will result in a fruitful exchange of ideas and stimulate an open discussion about the current challenges in meta-learning, as well as possible solutions.</p>
     
      <!--<h2 id="invited-speakers">Invited Speakers</h2>-->
      <h2 id="call-for-submissions">Call for Submissions</h2>  
      <p> We invite submissions for the First KAIST Summer Machine Learning Workshop Workshop (K), a interdisciplinary workshop that brings together researchers in machine learning, computational neuroscience, and their applications.</p>
      <p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>General Machine Learning</strong> (active learning, clustering, online learning, ranking, reinforcement learning, semi-supervised learning, time series analysis, unsupervised learning, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Learning</strong> (architectures, generative models, deep reinforcement learning, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Theory</strong> (bandits, game theory, statistical learning theory, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Optimization</strong> (convex and non-convex optimization, matrix/tensor methods, sparsity, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Probabilistic Inference</strong> (Bayesian methods, graphical models, Monte Carlo methods, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Trustworthy Machine Learning</strong> (accountability, causality, fairness, privacy, robustness, safety etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Applications</strong> (computational biology, audio and speech processing, natural language processing, healthcare, neuroscience, social good, climate science, etc.)</li>
      </ol>
      <p> The papers should be 8 pages in ICLR 2020 format excluding references (there can be unlimited appendix but reviewers are only required to read the first 8 pages). 
          The papers will be evaluated with respect to four criteria and we encourage authors to make sure that their submissions make these contributions clear. 
          First, the paper should be within the (broadly defined) scope of the workshop. 
          Second, the paper should explicitly motivate the question it poses. 
          Third, the paper should adequately contrast to prior work and explain the fundamental limitations preventing previous techniques from solving that question. 
          Finally, the paper should provide the key theoretical idea that allows to address the limitation and make progress in our understanding of the question. </p>
      <p>Submissions should be made to <a> Open Review </a> </p>
